============== OPERATORS ==============
Following are some common operators in python:
1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc.
2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.
3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
4. Logical operators: and, or, not.
"""

""" How it's Work:
7 + 4 = 11

Here: 
"7" and "4" is a operands.
"+" is a Arithmetic operators and "=" is Assignment operators.
"11" is a Result.
